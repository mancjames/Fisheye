Making an accessibility website based on a design breif for a photography website.

The main aims of this project were:

1. Create a website using JSON data and creating the elements using javascript object orientated programming.
2. Make the website accessible by ensuring that it can be navigated using keyboard only and including relevant requirements such as aria tags etc.
3. Make the website responsive for desktop and phone users.
4. Make the website interactive, including features such as allowed the user to add likes and being able to filter photographer by categories
5. Create a contact form, which includes validation checks against the user to ensure correct details added.
6. Use the factory method pattern in my code to take into account that the photographer profiles will change between video and images
